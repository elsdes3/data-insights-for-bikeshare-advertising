    "4. The overall ridership was chosen as the second criteria in order to select stations that have a history of high bike share demand. Stations that have only come online recently might have garnered interest due to their novelty but are not consistently capable of generating high bike share demand. The client's campaign should pick reliable stations in order to maximize awareness of the MCU continuing education program. For this reason, a presence of high overall demand was the second criteria chosen to identify top-performing stations.\n",
